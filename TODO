        I'm traying to install an make worktcpxd under solaris 2.6
with gcc 2.7.2, compiles fine (only shouts for a warning) and when
linking there are a lot of functions that the linker can't find.
They can be solved by adding the following compiler directives: -lxnet
-lresolv. Maybe in a next release you can add a feature in the confire
script to solve this problem.

You should add more info to the web page, like:
Example:

To redirect web traffic to another site:

        tcpxd 8888 www.yahoo.com 80

To see the GETs and html output:

        tcpxd --verbose --verbose --verbose --verbose 8888 www.yahoo.com 80
